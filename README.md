1. User interface design

As you can see, Iâ€™m definitely not a designer. But, this current UI satisfies all conditions as per the task.

- Users can see all available computers in the computer lab
- Computers are clearly indicated if they are reserved or available
- Users can reserve available computers (please see next image for another view)
- Users have an indication of when the computers will be available again
- Users can view schedules when the computer is not available
- Users can see how much remaining time to reserve the computer they have
- A simplified view is available on the right side of the screen
- All computers are sorted by availability to make it easier for users to reserve
- Additionally, available time is shown in the user profile picture in the top right corner
